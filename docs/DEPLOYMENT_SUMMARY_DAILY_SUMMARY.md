# Daily Summary Feature - Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Commit:** 8c364a8
**Impact:** Full multi-user daily summary support now available

---

## What Was Implemented

### Core Changes

1. **Extended Background Processor** (`audio_processor.py`)
   - Now processes both `transcription` and `daily_summary` job types
   - Routes jobs to appropriate handlers based on type
   - Applied same retry logic and safety limits to both types

2. **Multi-User Daily Summary Support** (`daily_summary.py`)
   - Accepts user-specific parameters (user_id, recipient_email)
   - Sends to user's notification email instead of hardcoded account
   - Enhanced logging with [SUMMARY] tags

3. **Job Processing Pipeline**
   - Background processor picks up pending daily_summary jobs
   - Checks user preferences before processing
   - Generates summary of previous day's transcripts
   - Sends email to user's notification email
   - Marks job as completed or failed

---

## How It Works

### User Perspective

1. User opens Android app → Processing Status screen
2. User taps "Request Daily Summary" button
3. **Within 30 seconds:**
   - Backend creates job in DynamoDB
   - Background processor picks it up
   - System generates summary of yesterday's transcripts
   - Email is sent to user's notification email
4. Job status changes from "Pending" → "Completed"
5. User receives email with categorized summary

### Technical Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
POST /api/user/request-daily-summary
    ↓
Create job: { job_type: 'daily_summary', status: 'pending' }
    ↓
Background Processor (runs every 30s)
    ↓
Scan: WHERE status='pending' (ALL job types)
    ↓
Route: if job_type=='daily_summary'
    → process_daily_summary_job()
    ↓
Fetch User Preferences → Get notification_email
    ↓
Generate Summary (yesterday's transcripts)
    ↓
Send Email → user's notification_email
    ↓
Mark Job: status='completed'
    ↓
Email Received ✅
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `decision_data/backend/services/audio_processor.py` (+110 lines)

**Changes:**
- Modified `process_single_job()` to route jobs by type
- Created `process_transcription_job()` (extracted from original)
- Created `process_daily_summary_job()` (new, handles daily summaries)
- Modified `get_eligible_pending_jobs()` to scan all job types

**Key Methods:**
```python
async def process_single_job(self, job: dict):
    """Route jobs to appropriate handler."""
    if job['job_type'] == 'daily_summary':
        await self.process_daily_summary_job(job)
    else:
        await self.process_transcription_job(job)

async def process_daily_summary_job(self, job: dict):
    """Generate and send daily summary."""
    # Fetch preferences
    # Generate summary for previous day
    # Send email
    # Mark complete
```

### 2. `decision_data/backend/workflow/daily_summary.py` (+10 lines)

**Changes:**
- Added optional `user_id` parameter
- Added optional `recipient_email` parameter
- Email now sent to recipient_email (not hardcoded account)

**Key Change:**
```python
def generate_summary(
    year, month, day, prompt_path,
    user_id: str = None,           # NEW
    recipient_email: str = None    # NEW
):
    # ...
    final_recipient_email = recipient_email or backend_config.GMAIL_ACCOUNT
    send_email(..., recipient_email=final_recipient_email)
```

---

## Database Integration

### Processing Jobs Table

New jobs created with:
```python
{
    job_id: "uuid",
    user_id: "user-uuid",
    job_type: "daily_summary",        # NEW TYPE
    status: "pending|processing|completed|failed",
    created_at: "2025-10-20T10:30:00+00:00",
    retry_count: 0,
    last_attempt_at: "2025-10-20T10:30:00+00:00"
}
```

### User Preferences Table

Required fields:
- `notification_email` - Email to receive summaries
- `enable_daily_summary` - Boolean toggle
- `summary_time_utc` - Preferred time (HH:MM format)

---

## Safety Features

### Retry Logic
- **Max Retries:** 3 attempts
- **Backoff:** 10 minutes between retries
- **Auto-fail:** After 3 attempts, marked as failed

### Timeouts
- **Processing Timeout:** 5 minutes per job
- **Job Age Limit:** 24 hours (prevents stuck jobs)
- **Check Interval:** 30 seconds

### User Preferences Checks
- If `enable_daily_summary = false`: Job completes silently
- If `notification_email` not set: Job fails with clear error
- If preferences not found: Job fails and can be retried

---

## Logging

### Log Tags

| Tag | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `[SUMMARY]` | Daily summary operation | Daily summary job started |
| `[EMAIL]` | Email sending | Email sent to user@example.com |
| `[AUDIO]` | General job processing | Processing daily_summary job |
| `[ERROR]` | Error condition | Failed to fetch preferences |
| `[FAIL]` | Permanent failure | Job marked as failed |
| `[SUCCESS]` | Successful completion | Daily summary sent |

### Example Log Output

```
[AUDIO] Processing daily_summary job 550e8400 (attempt 1/3) for user abc123
[SUMMARY] Processing daily summary job 550e8400 for user abc123
[SUMMARY] Generating summary for 2025-10-19
[EMAIL] Daily summary sent to user@example.com
[SUMMARY] Daily summary job 550e8400 completed successfully in 12.5s
[SUCCESS] Daily summary sent to user@example.com
```

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Code deployed and server restarted
- ✅ No startup errors in logs
- ✅ Background processor running (`[START] Starting cost-safe audio processor`)
- ✅ Processes pick up jobs every 30 seconds
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/user/request-daily-summary` functional

### Manual Testing

1. **Create test job in DynamoDB:**
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb put-item --table-name panzoto-processing-jobs \
     --item '{
       "job_id": {"S": "test-daily-001"},
       "user_id": {"S": "test-user"},
       "job_type": {"S": "daily_summary"},
       "status": {"S": "pending"},
       "created_at": {"S": "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z"},
       "retry_count": {"N": "0"}
     }'
   ```

2. **Wait 30 seconds for processor to pick it up**

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -50 /var/log/api.log | grep SUMMARY"
   ```

4. **Verify completion:**
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb get-item --table-name panzoto-processing-jobs \
     --key '{"job_id": {"S": "test-daily-001"}}'
   ```
