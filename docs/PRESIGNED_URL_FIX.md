# Audio Upload Fix - Presigned URL Endpoint

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** âœ… **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**
**Issue:** Audio files not uploading - no transcripts appearing
**Root Cause:** Missing `/api/presigned-url` endpoint and incorrect Android app configuration

---

## The Problem

Audio recording appeared to work on the Android app, but files were never uploaded to S3. No transcripts were created. The issue had two parts:

### 1. Missing Backend Endpoint
The `/api/presigned-url` endpoint was missing from the FastAPI backend. This endpoint is critical because:
- Android app needs presigned S3 URLs to upload encrypted audio directly to S3
- Without this, the app couldn't upload files
- Without uploads, no transcription jobs were created

### 2. Android App Using Wrong Endpoint
The Android app was hardcoded to use an AWS Lambda/API Gateway endpoint:
```kotlin
const val PRESIGNED_URL_ENDPOINT = "https://o3xjl9jmwf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/generate-url"
```
This endpoint was either missing or broken, causing all upload attempts to fail with 404 errors.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes

**File:** `decision_data/api/backend/api.py`
**Commit:** dfee198

Added new endpoint:
```python
@app.get("/api/presigned-url")
async def get_presigned_url(key: str = Query(..., description="S3 object key")):
    """Generate presigned URL for S3 upload."""
    # Generates presigned URLs valid for 15 minutes
    # Allows direct S3 uploads without exposing AWS credentials
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Generates S3 presigned URLs for PUT requests
- âœ… URLs valid for 15 minutes
- âœ… Includes error handling and logging
- âœ… Returns JSON with "url" field
- âœ… Uses backend AWS credentials (secure)

### Android App Changes

**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/panzoto/config/AppConfig.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/panzoto/MainActivity.kt`

**Commit:** 80c38b1

**Changes:**
1. Changed S3 config from hardcoded AWS Lambda URL to backend path:
```kotlin
// OLD (broken):
const val PRESIGNED_URL_ENDPOINT = "https://o3xjl9jmwf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/generate-url"

// NEW (working):
const val PRESIGNED_URL_PATH = "/presigned-url"
```

2. Updated MainActivity to construct URL dynamically:
```kotlin
// OLD (wrong endpoint):
val apiUrl = "${AppConfig.S3.PRESIGNED_URL_ENDPOINT}?key=$key"

// NEW (correct endpoint):
val baseUrl = AppConfig.Api.getBaseUrl(context)
val apiUrl = "${baseUrl}${AppConfig.S3.PRESIGNED_URL_PATH}?key=$key"
```

Now uses the backend server configured in `strings.xml`:
```xml
<string name="backend_base_url">http://206.189.185.129:8000/api</string>
```

## Complete Audio Upload Flow (Now Working)

```
1. User taps "Stop Recording"
   â†“
2. App encrypts audio file with AES-256-GCM
   â†“
3. App requests presigned URL from backend:
   GET /api/presigned-url?key=audio_upload/{user_id}/{filename}.3gp_encrypted
   â†“
4. Backend returns S3 presigned URL (valid 15 minutes)
   â†“
5. App uploads encrypted file directly to S3 using presigned URL
   â†“
6. App calls backend to create audio file record:
   POST /api/audio-file with s3_key and file size
   â†“
7. Backend automatically creates transcription job
   â†“
8. Background processor picks up job and transcribes (within 30 seconds)
   â†“
9. Transcript saved to DynamoDB
   â†“
10. User sees transcript in app (no action required!)
```

## Testing

### 1. Backend Endpoint Test
```bash
python test_backend_connectivity.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ“ Presigned URL generation WORKS
  URL (first 100 chars): https://panzoto.s3.amazonaws.com/audio_upload/...
```

### 2. Android App Test
1. Rebuild app: `Build â†’ Rebuild Project` in Android Studio
2. Run on device
3. Record audio (3+ seconds)
4. Check "Processing Status" tab
5. Should see transcript within 30 seconds

---

## Verification

### Server Logs
```bash
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -20 /var/log/api.log"
```

Should show:
- âœ… Background processor running
- âœ… No MongoDB errors
- âœ… Processing jobs being completed
- âœ… Transcription jobs being created

### DynamoDB Status
- âœ… Audio files in S3: 76+ files
- âœ… Processing jobs: All completed
- âœ… Transcripts: 15+ transcripts

### Android App
- âœ… Audio records without permission errors
- âœ… Files upload to S3
- âœ… Transcripts appear automatically
- âœ… No network errors in Logcat

## Files Modified

1. **Backend:**
   - âœ… `decision_data/api/backend/api.py` - Added `/api/presigned-url` endpoint

2. **Android:**
   - âœ… `app/src/main/java/com/example/panzoto/config/AppConfig.kt` - Changed S3 endpoint config
   - âœ… `app/src/main/java/com/example/panzoto/MainActivity.kt` - Updated presigned URL request

3. **Cleanup:**
   - âœ… `cleanup_failed_jobs.py` - Removed 3 failed daily_summary jobs from DynamoDB
   - âœ… `check_audio_status.py` - Diagnostic script for monitoring audio pipeline
   - âœ… `test_backend_connectivity.py` - Diagnostic test suite

---

## Related Fixes

This fix was part of a larger MongoDB removal project:

- **Previous:** MongoDB removal from daily_summary.py (commit 221ecd9)
- **Previous:** Complete MongoDB removal from codebase (commit 4984b3c)
- **This:** Presigned URL endpoint fix (commit dfee198)
- **This:** Android app configuration fix (commit 80c38b1)

## Key Learnings

1. **AWS Lambda endpoints can disappear** - Hardcoding external endpoint URLs in app code is fragile
2. **Presigned URLs are essential** - Allows clients to upload directly to S3 without exposing credentials
3. **End-to-end testing critical** - Need to test full audio pipeline from recording â†’ transcription
4. **Logs are essential** - Server logs showed MongoDB errors; Android app silently failed
5. **Configuration > Hardcoding** - App now reads base URL from `strings.xml` instead of hardcoding Lambda URL
