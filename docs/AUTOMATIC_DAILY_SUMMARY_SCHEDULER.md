# Automatic Daily Summary Scheduler

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED
**Commit:** 8d00b3e
**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Feature:** Automatic daily summary creation at user-preferred times

---

## Overview

Users now receive automatic daily summaries **without any manual action**. The system:

1. **Checks every 5 minutes** for users with daily summary enabled
2. **Matches current time** against each user's preferred `summary_time_utc`
3. **Automatically creates** a daily_summary job at the preferred time
4. **Runs once per day** per user (tracks by date)
5. **Processes through** the background audio processor
6. **Sends email** to user's notification email address

This is a **clean, independent service** separate from the audio processor to maintain clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Service Separation

```
API (api.py)
    ├── Starts: AudioProcessor (handles audio jobs)
    ├── Starts: DailySummaryScheduler (creates daily_summary jobs)
    └── Both run concurrently in background

Audio Processor (audio_processor.py)
    ├── Processes: transcription jobs
    ├── Processes: daily_summary jobs
    ├── Retries: failed jobs with backoff
    └── Timeout: max 5 minutes per job

Daily Summary Scheduler (daily_summary_scheduler.py) [NEW]
    ├── Scans: users with enable_daily_summary=true
    ├── Checks: current time vs summary_time_utc
    ├── Creates: daily_summary jobs at scheduled time
    ├── Tracks: one job per user per day
    └── Efficient: only checks every 5 minutes
```

### Clean Separation of Concerns

| Component | Responsibility | Location |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Audio Processor** | Process queued jobs | audio_processor.py |
| **Daily Summary Scheduler** | Create scheduled jobs | daily_summary_scheduler.py |
| **API** | Start/stop both services | api.py |

---

## How It Works

### User Setup (One-Time)

1. Open Android app → Settings
2. Ensure email is set (Notification Email)
3. Enable Daily Summary toggle
4. Choose preferred time (Summary Time, e.g., "09:00" UTC)
5. **Done!** - Automatic summaries will begin

### Daily Automatic Flow

**At User's Preferred Time (e.g., 09:00 UTC):**

```
Scheduler runs every 30 seconds (but expensive check every 5 min)
    ↓
Current time: 09:00 UTC
    ↓
Scheduler checks: Does user have daily_summary enabled? YES
    ↓
Scheduler checks: User's preferred time = 09:00? YES
    ↓
Scheduler checks: Already sent summary today? NO
    ↓
Scheduler creates: daily_summary processing job
    ↓
Job marked: daily_summary job ready for processing
    ↓
Audio Processor picks up job (within 30 seconds)
    ↓
Generate: Summary of yesterday's transcripts
    ↓
Send: Email to user's notification email
    ↓
Complete: Job marked as completed
    ↓
User receives: Email with daily summary ✅
```

### Example Timeline

```
Date: October 20, 2025

09:00 UTC
    ├─ Scheduler runs (every 5 min check cycle)
    ├─ Finds user with summary_time_utc="09:00"
    ├─ Creates daily_summary job
    └─ Job ID: abc123-def456

09:00-09:30 UTC
    ├─ Audio Processor scans for jobs (every 30s)
    ├─ Finds job abc123-def456
    ├─ Generates summary of Oct 19 transcripts
    ├─ Sends email to user@example.com
    └─ Marks job completed

User checks email
    └─ Receives: "PANZOTO: Daily Summary" with categories

Next day (Oct 21)
    └─ Scheduler can create another summary (date has changed)
```

## Scheduler Implementation Details

### DailySummaryScheduler Class

**Location:** `decision_data/backend/services/daily_summary_scheduler.py`

**Key Features:**

```python
class DailySummaryScheduler:
    """Manages automatic daily summary job creation."""

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize services
        self.transcription_service = UserTranscriptionService()
        self.preferences_service = UserPreferencesService()

        # Track which users already have summary today
        self.scheduled_today = {}  # {user_id: date_scheduled}

        # Efficient checking
        self.last_schedule_check = None
        self.schedule_check_interval_seconds = 300  # 5 minutes

    async def start_scheduler(self):
        """Run scheduler loop forever."""
        # Runs every 30 seconds but expensive check every 5 min

    async def check_and_schedule_summaries(self):
        """Check if it's time for any user to get summary."""
        # Get users with daily_summary enabled
        # Check each user's preferred time
        # Create job if time matches & not already sent today
```

### Scheduling Logic

**Time Window:** 5-minute window around preferred time

```python
# User prefers: 09:00
# Matches if current time is: 09:00, 09:01, 09:02, 09:03, or 09:04
time_match = (
    current_hour == pref_hour and
    current_minute >= pref_minute and
    current_minute < pref_minute + 5
)
```

**Why 5-minute window?** Provides flexibility if scheduler doesn't check at exact minute.

### Efficient Checking

- **Loop interval:** 30 seconds (cheap operations)
- **Schedule check interval:** 300 seconds = 5 minutes (expensive DynamoDB scan)
- **Result:** Balances responsiveness vs database load

```python
time_since_check = (now - self.last_schedule_check).total_seconds()
if time_since_check < 300:  # Only check every 5 minutes
    return
```

### Daily Tracking

Prevents multiple summaries per user per day:

```python
# After creating a summary job
self.scheduled_today[user_id] = current_date

# Next day, tracking resets automatically (different date object)
current_date = now.date()  # New date means can schedule again
```

---

## API Integration

### Startup Sequence

In `api.py`:

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Start background processor
    background_processor_task = asyncio.create_task(start_background_processor())
    logger.info("[OK] Background processor started successfully")

    # Start daily summary scheduler
    daily_summary_scheduler_task = asyncio.create_task(start_daily_summary_scheduler())
    logger.info("[OK] Daily summary scheduler started successfully")
```

### Shutdown Sequence

```python
@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    # Stop background processor
    stop_background_processor()
    background_processor_task.cancel()

    # Stop daily summary scheduler
    stop_daily_summary_scheduler()
    daily_summary_scheduler_task.cancel()
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create test user with preferences:**
   ```bash
   # In DynamoDB, ensure user has:
   - enable_daily_summary: true
   - notification_email: "test@example.com"
   - summary_time_utc: "09:00"  (or current UTC hour)
   ```

2. **Watch scheduler logs:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -f /var/log/api.log | grep SCHEDULER"
   ```

3. **Wait for scheduled time** to arrive (or set summary_time_utc to current hour + 1 minute)

4. **Verify job creation:**
   ```bash
   # Should see: "[SCHEDULER] Created auto daily summary job..."
   ```

5. **Verify job processing:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -f /var/log/api.log | grep SUMMARY"
   ```

6. **Check email:**
   ```
   Should receive: PANZOTO: Daily Summary
   With sections: Family, Business, Misc
   ```

## Behavior

### What Happens

| Time | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 09:00 UTC | Scheduler creates job | Job in pending status |
| 09:00-09:05 | Job window open | Scheduler can create more (if clock skew) |
| 09:05+ | Job window closed | Scheduler skips (already sent today) |
| 09:xx UTC | Processor picks up | Job processing |
| 09:yy UTC | Summary generated | Email sent |
| 09:zz UTC | Job complete | User receives email |

### Edge Cases

**User has transcription disabled:**
- Summary job completes silently (success, no error)
- No email sent

**User has no notification email:**
- Job fails with clear error
- Can be retried (up to 3 times)
- After 3 failures, marked as failed permanently

**User disabled daily summary:**
- Job completes silently (success)
- No email sent

**Server restarts:**
- Scheduler resumes from date tracking
- If today's summary already sent, won't send again
- If today's summary not yet sent, will send at next scheduled time

**Multiple servers (future):**
- Each server's scheduler would independently try to create job
- DynamoDB would create duplicate jobs
- Solution: Use distributed locking (future enhancement)

---

## Performance

### Efficiency

**Database Queries:**
- `get_users_with_daily_summary_enabled()`: Expensive scan, **runs every 5 minutes**
- Cost at scale: With 1000 users, scan runs 288 times/day = manageable

**Job Creation:**
- One DynamoDB write per matched user per day
- At 5-minute window with 1000 users: ~1000 writes per cycle

**Recommended Optimization (Future):**
- Add DynamoDB GSI for `enable_daily_summary=true` to reduce scan cost
- Consider time-based partitioning (users grouped by hour preference)

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Commit:** 8d00b3e pushed to main
2. **CI/CD:** Automatically deploys
3. **Server:** Restart to load new services
4. **Verification:** Check logs for `[SCHEDULER]` messages

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Restart server
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "pkill -9 uvicorn && sleep 2"
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "cd /root/decision_data && nohup /root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/decision-data-e8iAcpEn-py3.12/bin/uvicorn decision_data.api.backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 > /var/log/api.log 2>&1 &"

# Wait for startup
sleep 8

# Verify
curl http://206.189.185.129:8000/api/health
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "grep 'Daily summary scheduler' /var/log/api.log"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduler not creating jobs

**Check:**
1. Is scheduler running? Look for `[SCHEDULER]` in logs
2. Do users have `enable_daily_summary=true`?
3. Is `notification_email` set?
4. Is `summary_time_utc` in correct format? (HH:MM)
5. Is current UTC time within 5-minute window of preferred time?

**Command:**
```bash
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -100 /var/log/api.log | grep SCHEDULER"
```

### Jobs created but not processing

**Check:**
1. Is audio processor running? Look for `[SUMMARY]` in logs
2. Check job status in DynamoDB (should be pending)
3. Check retry count (should be 0 initially)
4. Are there any error messages?

**Command:**
```bash
ssh root@206.189.185.129 "tail -100 /var/log/api.log | grep SUMMARY"
```

### Email not received

**Check:**
1. Is MongoDB configured? (DNS must resolve)
2. Are Gmail credentials valid?
3. Is Gmail app password correct? (not regular password)
4. Check job status (completed or failed?)

**MongoDB issue:**
```
pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError: The DNS query name does not exist
```
→ Configure MongoDB URI or disable daily summary feature

**Gmail issue:**
- Generate new app password at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account
