<instruction>
Please take the transcript taken from <source data> and separate into: family_info, business_info, and misc_info. Family info are related to personal appointments, meetings with friends, children related events, bills, etc. Business info are work related things like, meeting notes, meeting schedules, meeting transcript, pair programming transcript, etc. Misc_info are miscellanies info that doesn't relate to either business or family info. This include small talk or chit chat during work time that is just for talking. No actual plan is going to be made. It sounds like talking about kids, but there is no actual decision or plans being made. 

For each type of info, summarize the transcript and split it into items in a list. Each item in the list is distinct from another. If a calendar event needs to be created, state the time, place, and give a quick title in 20 characters. 

Format the output like the output_format section. It will be converted into a JSON parser.
